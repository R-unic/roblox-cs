Roblox CSharp to Lua compiler

# To-do
- Imports
- Inheritance chains 🤮
- `for`/`while` loops
- `using name = value` expressions (equivalent to `:=` operator in other languages) (MAYBE)
- Property declarations
- Macro `IEnumerable<T>` (or just `List<T>`) methods
- Classes/structs/interfaces nested in classes/structs/interfaces
- Restrict `volatile` and `partial` usage (`partial` maybe supported in the future)
- Polyfills:
	- The rest of the `Math` library
